                    <p class="text">I am three blocks from the Broadway local subway stop, just past West 204th Street.
                        Right before me is a time machine, capable of transporting me back to when most of Manhattan
                        north of Canal Street consisted of hilly meadows, orchards and plowed fields. The Dyckman
                        Farmhouse and Museum is the oldest remaining farmhouse in the borough, made of fieldstone, brick
                        and white clapboard with a gambrel room and Dutch door, dating from about 1783 — a magical stop
                        on Broadway’s least-discovered northern stretch.</p>

                        on. One year it might be forests, another year it might be wildlife. And each year there is a
                        new host; a city which is the centre point for all the celebrations.</p>
